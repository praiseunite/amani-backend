# CODEOWNERS file for Amani Backend
# 
# This file defines code ownership and automatic review requests
# Owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a PR
# that modifies code they own.
#
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence.
# More specific patterns should be placed after less specific ones.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
# These owners will be requested for review unless a later match takes precedence
